- Can we do better on predicting about open issue?
### Potential Solution
- Group projects into different categories (clustering), and do predictions on each of groups.


## Problem B

- There may be more useful indicators for better health predictions.
### Potential Solution
- Consult with industrial domain experts for their opinion about key features of success/fail projects.
- Convert those key features into new indicators for further predictions.


## Problem C

- Do we get enough literature review to find state-of-the-art? What algorithms are commonly explored but not used in our experiments?
### Potential Solution
- Do an updated literature review and apply new methods into our benchmarks.


## Problem D

- Can we simplify and generalize the prediction procedures?
### Potential Solution
- Use only first 10/20/30 months' data as training if it's enough.
- Group projects into different categories and show they can be treated as just a few dozen projects (clustering). Put a new project into its home cluster then use old models to predict this new project.
